I made this project by combining the story of Liang Zhu (butterfly lovers) in Chinese mythology and the story of lotus Zen in Buddhism.<br/> 

The story of Liang Zhu tells the story of a couple of lovers who died in pursuit of free love in order to get rid of the shackles of secularism and feudalism, and then turned into butterflies. The lotus flower means that out of mud but not stained, and it has the meaning of no desire and holiness in Buddhism. Here I was looking for, when the souls who sacrificed for love and freedom shuttle in the lotus pond without desires and dust, what kind of sparks will they collide with? <br/>

At the same time, I added cyberpunk elements to make a story that seems to be far away from human fireworks more intimate. It is not only a question explored in ancient times, but also a question explored now and in the future. Can the ever-changing pool of water help a love-confused couple find answers? The combination of Zen and punk style makes it more all-encompassing.

## Arduino & Open Frameworks (C++)
I made this project with Arduino and Open Frameworks. The sound is made with the combination ofMaxi and sensors. The two objects chased below were made by Boids. This keeps objects behind chasing objects in front according to the compact pressure between them. And once the object in front is chased, it will change color. 

Arduino changes the size and frequency of sound through Ultrasonic Sensor and rheostat. At the same time, their sensing values will be displayed at the bottom of the screen in real time. In addition to changing the light in the lotus pond, the buttons on the keyboard can also control the flashing of the light bulbs in the Arduino. This visually shows the light in the screen with physical lights.

Chasing each other under the water is Liang Zhu and his wife who turned into butterflies.
The ever-changing and turbulent is the chaotic world. The calm and unyielding lotus is a symbol of the Buddha who is neither sad nor happy. Only the Buddha light on his body can show that he still cares about the world. Blocks that appear and disappear like a mosaic, just like in the age of cyberpunk. As its theme makes people think,can the cold and precise computer age hold onto this fleeting glimmer of divine light?
